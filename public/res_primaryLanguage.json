      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eric Kinuthia. I am a junior software developer looking to begin my professional career in the tech industry. Before I decided to change careers, I was working as a delivery driver for Amazon. It was a very labor-intensive job with very long days. Working there helped me learn how to work as a team and develop a growth mindset which is critical to becoming a good software developer. I have always been passionate about computers because of their problem-solving capabilities. I chose to transition into software development at this point in my life to equip myself with the technical know-how and skills to be able to create software that makes people lives easier. And most importantly to be able to do what I love for work.",
